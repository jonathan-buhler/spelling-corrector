    "### Equation to maximize\n",
    "Given a misspelled word `w`, we want to create a function `correct(w)` which returns the word the user was most likely trying to type. As there is unavoidable ambiguity in correcting a word (\"ther\" could be \"their\", \"there\", or \"the\", just to name a few) we will assign probabilities to each possible correction (candidate). Each candidate `c`'s probability represents the likelihood that given misspelled word `w`, `c` was the intended word: `P(c|w)`. However, this is a difficult probability to evaluate as there are too many factors invovled. Ideally, we want to break down the problem into smaller equations and then combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem) tells us that `P(c|w)` is equivalent to `(P(c) * P(w|c)) / (P(w)`. `P(w)` is simply the probability of the misspelled word appearing, which is the same for all candidates so we can ignore it as it doesn't factor into the maximization. This leaves us with the equation: `P(c) * P(w|c)` to maximize over all candidates `c` for a misspelled word `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was the most complicated bit of this entire exercise, it's all downhill from here!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking down the equationa\n",
    "`P(c)`: The probability of the candidate word occurring in an English text. Words like \"the\", \"and\" etc. occur far more frequently than words like \"monopoly\" or \"horticulture\". This gives them a higher probability of occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(w|c)`: The probability that the misspelled word `w` was typed when the author meant `c`. For example, `P(\"clasroom\"|\"classroom\")` is very high, while `P(\"cladfalsasrosfsafam\"|\"classroom\")` is very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over all candidates `c`: We can't evaluate the equation for every word in the English language, so instead we'll evaluate it on words that are a couple simple edits away from the misspelled word `w`."
